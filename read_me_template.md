# ReadMe Template

1. Make sure all information on the ReadMe is accurate: (particularly version numbers)
    - Installation instructions should be correct (including dependencies)
    - If a docker file is included instructions on how to use it should be included
    - At least one operating system should be fully covered.
2. In general, the ReadMe should start with a **"Table of Contents"** that should contain the following sections (as applicable):
    - Installation
        - Requirements
        - Building
        - Deploying
    - Database Seed
    - API Specification (Any sub-sections that help explain the API)
    - Testing
    - Additional Configuration
    - External Services (if applicable – i.e. Google Maps APIs)
    - Docker 
    - ChangeLog
3. Repositories that have been approved to be open-source must contain these additional sections:
    - License
    - Contributing
    - Security Issues
    - Code of Conduct
